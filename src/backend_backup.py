'Fluorescent Afternoon'
Verse:
G - Em - C - G - G - Em - C - D
Morning light through dusty panes  
Coffee cooling in my hand 
The screen glows blue with ancient code 
Only half of it is planned 
The professor clears his throat 
Like a ritual we all know 
I underline a word called theory 
But I don't know where it goes 
Chorus:
C - G - Em - C - C - G - D
Hello, pointers, my old friends 
I've come to misread you again 
Because a slide was softly creeping 
Left its syntax while I was sleeping 
And the thought that formed inside my brain 
Was interrupted once again 
By the hum of fluorescent afternoon

'Late Bell (AM Drive)'
Hook:
Fm - Db - Ab - Eb - Fm - Db - Ab - Eb
I'm riding to school with the sun in my eyes 
Radio low but the bass still cries 
Running these lights, yeah I'm losing my time 
Late bell ringing but I'm still gonna slide 
Windows down, let the cold air bite 
Thoughts too loud in the early light 
I'm not awake but I'm still alive 
On the way to class, yeah I'm still gonna ride 
Verse:
Fm - Db - Ab - Eb - Fm - Db - Ab - Eb
Seat lean back, backpack on the floor 
Same street dreams that I had before 
Teachers talk but my mind elsewhere 
Trying find a future in the traffic glare 
Gas light on, but I'm pushing my luck 
Need more sleep, need way more trust 
Clock keep yelling that I'm behind 
But my soul moving faster than the hands of time

Selling answers in a paper-thin skin 
Talks real loud, says he's saving my soul 
But he's reading from a script he was sold 
Dorm room rage, hotel stage 
Same old war in a different age 
Says “think free” but it sounds rehearsed 
Like a bad idea wearing a tie and a curse 
Pre-chorus:
A - C - A - C
You say it's simple 
Like I'm dumb 
If I don't clap 
You say I've lost 
Chorus:
C - A - Em - G - C - A - Em - G

Talking at me 
Like I'm broken 
Like I'm empty 
You don't scare me 
You just bore me 
Selling fear like 
It's conformity
